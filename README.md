# Thread Dump Analyzer

This project was an excuse to make an application of the Scala JS stack :o)

The aim for this project is to build a standalone tool that produces, in a web browser, analytic data based on a provided Java thread dump.
The rendering phase is based on Twitter Bootstrap. 

To use it, just run :
 
 ```
 $ sbt fastOptJS
 ```
 
 and serve the test.html page.
